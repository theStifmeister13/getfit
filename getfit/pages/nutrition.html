            <strong>IIFYM</strong>, or “If It Fits Your Macros,” is a type of flexible dieting that helps people lose weight without feeling overly restricted.

            Rather than focusing on calories, IIFYM tracks macronutrients instead — namely protein, fat and carbohydrates.

            This allows for much more flexibility since all foods can be enjoyed as long as they fit into your macros for the day.

            Here are the basic principles of IIFYM, details on how to follow it and the pros and cons of this approach.
            
            Macronutrients, or macros, are the four types of food molecules the body can break down for energy. 

            <p>Three types of macronutrients are tracked in IIFYM:

            Protein, which has 4 calories per gram.
            Carbohydrates, which have 4 calories per gram.
            Fat, which has 9 calories per gram.</p>

            <p>Following the IIFYM diet is pretty simple, and only requires a few steps:</p>
            <p>1. Calculating your macros: Calculations are used to determine how many grams of protein, carbs and fat you need each day in order to meet your weight goals.</p>
            <p>2. Meeting your macros: Once you know your macros, you just need to stay within them each day. Food intake is tracked and adjusted as needed.</p>           
            
            While tracking is important, there is no need to stress about hitting your macros exactly every single day.
            As long as you don’t go over each macronutrient by more than 5 grams, or under by more than 10 grams, you should still see results.

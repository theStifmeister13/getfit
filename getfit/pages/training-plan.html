            <p>The full body workout routine is one of the most proven types of weight training programs of all time. 
            It can work for most goals (building muscle, increasing strength, etc.) 
            and experience levels (beginner, intermediate, and advanced).</p>

            <p>A full body workout routine is a strength training program built around training most or all of 
            the entire body during each workout rather than splitting it up into different parts.</p>

             
            It can be done using a 2-day split, 3-day split, or 4-day split.</p><p>There are a few different ways to schedule full body workouts over the course of the week.

            <p>Many consider the 3-day version to be the best choice for the majority of people doing full body workouts. It allows for an optimal frequency for the goals most people have, it will fit perfectly into most people’s schedules, and when designed correctly, 
            it’s unlikely to be problematic for most people in terms of issues with recovery or overuse injuries.</p>

                It’s uses the 3-day version of the full body split, 
                although it only involves two different workouts: the A workout and the B workout. 
                You simply alternate between them on each of the three training days so that you’re doing 
                A-B-A one week and B-A-B the next. And so on.

  <h3>Lower Body Workout</h3>

            <p>On this day, you’d train the entire lower body to some degree. 
            Here’s what that means in terms of body parts being targeted, 
            along with the amount of exercises I’ve found to be ideal for each.</p>

            <p>Abs are typically trained along with the lower body. Also note that the lower back, 
            which is technically a part of the upper body, is often considered part of the lower 
            body workout simply because it’s involved (source) in so many compound leg exercises 
            (deadlifts, squats, etc.).</p></span>
